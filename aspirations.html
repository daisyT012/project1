		<h4>What do You Want to do</h4>
		<p>
		People are always asking you what do you want to do. Whether if you are 8, 15, or 18. As the number increases
		the more your answer has to be rational, realistic, and serious. But when I was 8 I wanted to be a veterinarian. 
		When I was 15 I wanted to be a interior designer. The idea of being a veterinarian was no longer in my mind, as a matter of fact 
		I realized there was no way I could possibly be a veterinarian if I flinched everytime I saw blood. Now that I am 18
		all I can say is that of course I want to something relating to Information Technology. It is still unclear to me 
		what I want to do specifically. As I think about my future I do not want to be someone who is behind a computer all 
		day and is miserable. I really want to be someone who is truly happy and affecting peoples lives through my work of information technology.

		<h4>Dreams</h4>
		<p>
		One of my biggest dreams has been to open up a museum. 
		A museum that always changes. 
		It can have a theme or topic for a certain period of time. 
		I would also love to work with holograms. 
		I always loved going to field trips when I was younger, especially to the museum.
		The museum could have activities for people to learn programming and other fun things.
